This is a small script that simulates the process of mutation drift in and constant size diploid population, the simulation plot was a modification of the [function](http://blog.phytools.org/2018/03/coalescent-genealogy-plot-in-r.html) ```coalescent.plot()``` that can be found in the [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/learnPopGen/index.html) ```learnPopGen```. The function was modified to include a mutation argument to add new alleles. In addition of plotting the change in the alleles there is a plot of the alleles frequencies and of the homozygozyty and heterozygozyty.

To use the plot firts select the desired parameters and hit the ```Plot``` bottom. You have control over the initial number of alleles, but not the initial frequencies that are random; the population size (N), note that as we are assuming a diploid population we have 2N alleles; the number of generations, and the mutation rate. You also can choose to sort the alleles each iteration of the simulation to make a plot easier to follow.
